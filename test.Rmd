#I began by downloading three files - naming them raw_bat, pitch, and salary
#These were Downloaded from the Lahman Baseball Database
#Sean Lahman has collected statistics from the MLB from 1871(!) up until present day
#The info goes up to 2017 for bat and pitch, and 2016 for salaries

  clean_names()

#Now, I am going to create a graphic which visualizes the statistic I read online that piqued my interest
#using the batting data, I will show total strikeouts in the MLB for every year since 2005
#I will do this using a pretty standard group_by, summarize combo


initial_strikeout_data <- raw_bat %>%
  filter(year_id >= 2005) %>%
  group_by(year_id) %>%
  summarize(total_strikeouts = sum(so))

#Here is a table of the data... Every year since 2007 has been a new MLB record!

initial_strikeout_data %>%
  kable()

#And here is a scatterplot, using ggplot2

initial_strikeout_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year_id, y = total_strikeouts)) + geom_line()

# 30,000 strikeouts in '05 to 40,000 seems like a huge jump! A ~30% increase in a dozen years!

#Looking through older data, I realized there were less total At bats back in the day
#due to shorter seasons and fewer teams in the league. That's why this graphic is misleading

old_strikeout_data <- raw_bat %>%
  filter(year_id >= 1910) %>%
  group_by(year_id) %>%
  summarize(total_strikeouts = sum(so))

old_strikeout_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year_id, y = total_strikeouts)) + geom_line()

#It became apparent that the statistic of interest was ACTUALLY strikeouts per at bat
#That's how you can tell if people are truly stiking out significantly more

strikeout_perAB_data <- raw_bat %>%
  filter(year_id >= 2005) %>%
  group_by(year_id) %>%

#Turns out this is increasing quite significantly also! ALSO up ~30% since 2005

strikeout_perAB_data %>%
  kable()

strikeout_perAB_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year_id, y = so_per_ab)) + geom_line()

#This makes sense - there haven't been more teams added to the league, or more games
#added to the schedule since 2005, so total SO and average SO should align

#What I wasn't expecting was what how SO per AB would look since 1910

old_strikeout_perAB_data <- raw_bat %>%

#Now this intrigues me.. and is what I want to explore througout the rest of this project
#How has the league changed over time, and why has "the strikeout" increased so drastically

#I first decided to check how stats like Batting Average and HRs per AB changed over time
#Tod do this, I summarized some new stats for each year since 1910

old_batting_filtered <- raw_bat %>%

  geom_line(aes(y = mean_ba, color = "Mean BA")) +

#However, if we just look from 2005 on, this relationship doesn't seem to hold as much

batting_filtered <- raw_bat %>%
  filter(year_id >= 2005) %>%
  group_by(year_id) %>%

#The same goes for this stretch in the 50s and 60s, where a similar relationship holds

#So that is where I am now
#My next idea is to see the stats for the highest payed players on each team over the years
#My suspicion is that maybe these stats can show me what types of players are most valued over time
#and how that may have been related to the rise in strikeouts

#This gets the highest paid player from each team in each year since 1985 

max_salaries <- raw_salary %>%
  group_by(year_id, team_id) %>%
  filter(salary == max(salary))

#Now I want to get the stats for each of these players
#I need to combine the pitcher and batter data, because salary data includes all positions

#the code below seems a little off, because the sum of raw_bat and raw pitch observations
#is not the same as the total all_players observations, but for now i'll roll with it

all_players <- full_join(raw_bat, raw_pitch, by = c("player_id", "year_id")) %>%

#This code below gives me any player who was EVER a top paid player in the league for a team
#and shows the stats for their whole career... I don't know if that's what I want

#I don't know why, but that filter code below seemed to be what made the left_join below work

top_players <- all_players %>%
  filter((player_id %in% max_salaries$player_id) & (year_id %in% max_salaries$year_id))

#Now we have top paid players for each year and their stats

#Some things I want to investigate -
#1. are top paid players over time pitchers or batters? Has it evolved?
#2. Are the batters getting paid the most becoming better homerun hitters? Or OBP guys? etc
#3. Are there other trends I can find?

#The data seems to be slightly off here, but I think it is good enough to stick with

total_max_salary_players <- salaries_and_stats %>%

#Tod do this, I will filter out players whose pitching stats are NA (here, wins suffices)

#There might be a slight trend up towards paying pitchers, but not much
#And the uptick may be accounted for by the growing number of teams in the MLB
#Not worth further investigation

#Let's look at the batters and their stats now
#I'm gonna peek at the same stats as I had above, but only for these top players

#It seems like These top batters are staying pretty consistent with HR per AB
#Their batting averages have fallen decently since '06, but still seem to be
#on par with a historical trend around .280 (since 1985)
